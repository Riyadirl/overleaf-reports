\section{Gap Analysis}
\subsection{Budget Gap}
\textbf{Gap:} Some features will require more money from our actual budget. For example, if we implement a messaging feature, it may require an additional server, which will not be beneficial for our system to maintain.
\newline
\textbf{Solution:} Exclude those features that require extra money.

\subsection{Feature Gap}
\textbf{Gap:} Certain features might be absent, even though there is a significant demand for them or they exist in other established systems.
\newline
\textbf{Solution:} Recognize these features and incorporate them.

\subsection{Resource Gap}
\textbf{Gap:} Insufficient resources, including skilled developers, designers, infrastructure, and accountants, have been assigned for the system.
\newline
\textbf{Solution:} Coordinate with project management to secure the availability and proper distribution of the necessary human and technical resources.

\subsection{Advertisement Gap}
\textbf{Gap:} Lack of home renters due to inadequate advertising by administrators.
\newline
\textbf{Solution:} Investing in advertising will be beneficial for the system's potential.

\subsection{Geographical Area Gap}
\textbf{Gap:} Inconsistencies in how the system is perceived, potentially affecting user trust and engagement.
\newline
\textbf{Solution:} Implement targeted marketing campaigns to enhance brand awareness in specific regions. Gather and respond to user feedback to address region-specific concerns.

\section{ System Design}


\subsection{Context Diagram}
Context diagrams are used to represent the context of a system. They are often used in the
design phase of a project as a way to explore different design options and their impacts. A
context diagram is usually created using an external tool like EdrawMax, but it can also be
drawn by hand. It can be used in conjunction with other diagrams such as an activity
diagram or sequence diagram to make it easier to understand how each part of the system
interacts with one another.
\newline

    \caption{System Context Diagram}
    \label{fig:context_diagram}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Use Case Diagram}

A use case diagram doesn't go into a lot of detail—for example, don't expect it to model the order in which steps are performed. Instead, a proper use case diagram depicts a high-level overview of the relationship between use cases, actors, and systems. Experts recommend that use case diagrams be used to supplement a more descriptive textual use case.

ideas for use case diagram:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Representing the goals of system-user interactions.
    \item Defining and organizing functional requirements in a system.
    \item Specifying the context and requirements of a system.
    \item Modeling the basic flow of events in a use case.

\subsection{Data Flow Diagram}
A data flow diagram shows the way information flows through a process or system. It includes data inputs and outputs, data stores, and the various subprocesses the data moves through. DFDs are built using standardized symbols and notation to describe various entities and their relationships. 

Data flow diagrams visually represent systems and processes that would be hard to describe in just words. You can use these diagrams to map out an existing system and make it better or to plan out a new system for implementation. Visualizing each element makes it easy to identify inefficiencies and produce the best possible system

\textbf{Levels of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Level 0 DFD:} This highest-level DFD provides an overview of the entire system. It showcases major processes, data flows, and data stores without delving into internal process details.
    
    \item \textbf{Level 1 DFD:} Offering a more detailed view, this level breaks down major processes from the Level 0 DFD into sub-processes. Each sub-process is shown as a separate process, detailing associated data flows and data stores.
    
    \item \textbf{Level 2 DFD:} Building on the Level 1 DFD, this level delves further by breaking down sub-processes into more detailed segments. Each sub-process is represented separately, displaying corresponding data flows and data stores.
    
    \item \textbf{Level 3 DFD:} This is the most detailed level, providing an intricate view of processes, data flows, and data stores within the system. It's typically used for complex systems, offering detailed descriptions of inputs, processing steps, outputs, and associated data elements.

\subsection{Class Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \textbf{What is a Class:}
A class describes a group of objects with similar roles in a system, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structural features (attributes) defining object state.
    \item Behavioral features (operations) describing object interactions.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Purpose of Class Diagrams:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show static structure of classifiers in a system.
    \item Provide a basic notation for other UML structure diagrams.
    \item Help developers and team members understand system structure.
    \item Assist Business Analysts in modeling systems from a business perspective.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Class Notation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class Name: Appears in the first partition.
    \item Class Attributes: Shown in the second partition, with types.
    \item Class Operations (Methods): Displayed in the third partition, defining services provided by the class.

\subsection{CRC Card}
CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) diagrams are a type of diagram in the field of
software engineering that are used to model the responsibilities of a system and the
relationships between the different classes in the system. CRC diagrams are useful for
understanding the responsibilities of each class in the system and for identifying the
relationships between the classes.
Here are the steps to create a CRC diagram:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step 1: Identify Classes}
    \item[] - Identify distinct entities in the system design and list each class.
    
    \item \textbf{Step 2: Define Responsibilities}
    \item[] - Document responsibilities for each class, detailing the tasks it performs.
    
    \item \textbf{Step 3: Identify Collaborators}
    \item[] - Determine other classes or objects each class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities.
    
    \item \textbf{Step 4: Create CRC Cards}
    \item[] - Generate index cards or notes for each class. Write the class name on one side and responsibilities/collaborators on the other.
    
    \item \textbf{Step 5: Refine and Change}
    \item[] - Utilize CRC cards to refine the design, discussing and rearranging class interactions for design improvement.
    
    \item \textbf{Step 6: Update}
    \item[] - Continuously update CRC cards as the design evolves, reflecting any changes or additions to the system.

\subsection{Sequence diagram}
Sequence Diagrams are interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out. They capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration. Sequence Diagrams are time focus and they show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical axis of the diagram to represent time what messages are sent and when.
Sequence Diagrams captures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The interaction that takes place in a collaboration that either realizes a use case or an operation.
    \item High-level interactions between user of the system and the system, between the system and other systems, or between subsystems.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment diagram}
Deployment diagram is a diagram that shows the configuration of run time processing nodes and the components that live on them. Deployment diagrams is a kind of structure diagram used in modeling the physical aspects of an object-oriented system. They are often be used to model the static deployment view of a system
\textbf{Purpose of Deployment Diagrams}
\begin{itemize}
    \item They show the structure of the run-time system
    \item They capture the hardware that will be used to implement the system and the links between different items of hardware.
    \item They model physical hardware elements and the communication paths between them.
    \item They can be used to plan the architecture of a system.

\subsection{UI design}
 User interface is the part of the system with which the users interact. It includes the screen displays that provide navigation through the system, the screens and forms that capture data, and the reports that the system produces (whether on paper, on the Web, or via some other media). This chapter introduces the basic principles and processes of interface design and discusses how to design the interface structure and standards.
